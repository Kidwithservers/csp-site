# Lesson Plan: Course introduction

## Learning Objectives
Essential Question: What is a computer and why do we study Computer Science?
Learning Objective: Students will be able to understand what a computer system is, the benefits of studying computer science, and the format and design of the course.

## Instruction
This lesson will open with a review of student's attitudes and experience with computer science, conducted through a discussion of what a computer is, and a survey of student's computing and programming experience. The lesson will then proceed into a review of the definition of computer science, and an introduction of CS as an academic discipline. After this, the structure and format of the course will be introduced, including the AP big ideas, AP computational thinking practices, the course's server and websites, and the format of the course's homework, assessments, and lessons. Finally, the lesson will conclude with an overview of the AP CSP exam, and the collection of student's information for the purposes of setting up the course server.

## Assessment
