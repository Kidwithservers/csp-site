# Lesson Plan: Introduction to the Linux Course Environment

## Learning Objectives
Essential Question: How do we connect to and access the class's server?  
Learning Objective: Students will be able to connect to the class's programming server, then create and edit a file.

## Instruction
This lesson will start with a distribution of information sheets to all students, which contain customized instructions for how to install the software that will be needed for the course. Students will then be guided through the process of setting up a SSH and VScode connection to the central server. Students will then be introduced to the VScode editor, and how to use it.

## Assessment
This information will be assessed via the fist class project that will assess all introductory skills covered in this section. 

## Materials and textbook
 - Individual connection information sheets
 - SSH certificates

 Textbook: Chapter 11, Sections 1 and 2

## Notes
This is going to be a slow day. We will be walking all students through the process of installing vscode, importing a ssh private key, and then getting started with the graphical editor. I expect several hiccups along the way due to different OSes, lack of basic skills, and other issues. Tomorrow, we will then be covering command-line functions.
