# Importing from other files
The file we will be importing is called `example.py`.  It's contents is listed below.
```python
def add(x, y):
    z = x + y
    return(z)

global_variable = 100

def get_value():
    return("Example Data")
```


## Example 1: Importing an entire file
```python
import example

example.add(4, 5)
```

## Example 2: Importing only certian functions
```python
from example import add

add(4, 5)
```

## Example 3: Importing static values
```python
import example

# You cannot import variables from other files. This will not work.

print(global_variable)

# If you have to access a preset value, you can get it from a function, but this is usually a very bad idea. Think about why you would have to use this.

print(get_value())
```
