# Dictionaries
Useful notes on dicts:
- Dicts are useful when you have data that has a name associated with it, and you plan to access that data by name
- You can iterate through a list however
- Dicts are not suited to just storing a list of items (you cannot sort them, and they are missing many other array functions)
- You can mix and match any combination of arrays and dicts to form complex multi-level structures.

## Example
```python
# print(dictest["color"])
dictest.update({"type": "gas"})
dictest.update({"color": "blue"})
dictest["color"] = "blue"
del(dictest["type"])

for x in dictest:
    print(x)

for x in dictest:
    print(dictest[x])
```
