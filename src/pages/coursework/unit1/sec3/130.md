# Binary Search
For the ap exam, you need to remember the following:
1. Binary search is a fast way to search through a list. It is faster than sequential or linier searches
2. Binary search is usefull on all lists, but especially usefull for large lists
3. Binary search only works on ordered (or sorted) lists
4. Binary search will return the index of the searched for element

```python
def search(array, low, high, target):
    # Return -1 if element is not found (this would be true when the program has run so long that high and low have passed eachother)
    if low > high:
        return(-1)
    # Calculate midpoint of the subsection of the list indicated by high and low
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    # If mid equals the target element, stop running program, because the answer has been found
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return(mid)
    # If target is greater than the midpoint, call the function on the upper subset of the list
    # This subset is indicated by chaning the low and high values on the next call
    # We will then return the value provided by this call of the function
    elif target > arr[mid]:
        return search(array, mid+1, high, target)
    # Same as the previous step, only operates on the lower half of the list
    elif target < arr[mid]:
        return search(array, low, mid-1, target)

# An example SORTED array to run the program on
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]

print(
    search(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, 12))
```
