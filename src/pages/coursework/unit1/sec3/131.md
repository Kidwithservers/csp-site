# 2D arrays
Other notes for this section:
- You can add as many dimensions to an array as you want. Just keep adding arrays inside of arrays
- Each time you access an element in a multi-dimensional array, you subtract a dimension. (IE: The first element in a 3D array is a 2D array)
- To access the individual elements in an array, you need one loop for each dimension (IE: You need two loops for a 2D array)
- Multi-dimensional arrays are very useful for when you need to store a variable number of arrays

## Example
```python
arr = [
    [1,2,3,4],
    [4,3,2,1],
    [2,4,6,8],
    [8,6,4,2]
]

print(arr)
print(arr[0])
print(arr[0][0])

for x in arr:
    print(x)
    for y in x:
        print(y)
```
