# Test study guide

**The test will be on Wednesday, November 2nd**  
Content you can expect on this test:
- Loops (for and while) and if statements
- Functions, arguments, and return values
- Global, vs enclosing vs local scope, good coding practices
- Definition of algorithms, O() notation categories (You will need to know categories, but will not have to find exact values) and, unsolvable problems
- Arrays, looping through arrays and array functions (len, append, pop, etc)
- Strings and, string functions (especially split)
- Debugging, try/except blocks, validating input
- Queues
- Binary search  
  
The quiz will be 30 - 35 questions, and will be a 50/50 mixture of real ap problems (some pseudocode, some conceptual) and course specific problems (python code and concepts)  
**General note: from here on out, you will be expected to be able to use and implement these functions without help. If you need help with any of this, please let me know so we can review in class.**
