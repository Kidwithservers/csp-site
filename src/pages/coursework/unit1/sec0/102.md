# String functions
The following programs are some basic examples of string based functions.

### Example 0: General string functions
```python
demo = "  This is a string  "

# Strings have their own functions too
# Two of the most important are .strip() and .split()
# .strip() removes extraneous characters, and returns a new string
demo.strip()
print(demo)
demo = demo.strip()
print(demo)

# .split() splits one string into an array of strings delimitated (or marked by) a character
# by default, it will use any whitespace
lidemo = demo.split()
print(lidemo)

# Also important is .find(), which will return the index of the start of the search term, or
# or -1 if it is not found. Count will return the number of times the search string appears
print(demo.find("string"))
print(demo.count("s"))

# Upper and lower are fairly self-explanatory
print(demo.upper())
print(demo.lower())

# replace will return a string with all occurrences of arg1 replaced with arg2
print(demo.replace("string", "foobar"))
```

### Example 1: String splits extras
```python
data = "this/is/some/data"

print(data.split("/"))
print(data.split("s"))
print(data.split("is"))

spaces = "This is a string"
print(spaces.split("s"))
print(spaces.split("is"))
# Note how .split() always removes whitespace
```

## Example 2: String to int conversion
This example shows how you can use the `map` function to convert strings to other types of data so you can use the data in other parts of your program.
```python
nums = "1 2 3 4"

# The following code is very important and useful, but is complex.
# At the very least, you will need to remember it verbatim

# First, the string is stripped, before being split. Dot functions can be chained
# Then, comes the map function:
# The map function accepts a function as the first argument, and an iterable as the second argument
# It will then run the function on each element of the iterable, returning a map object
# This map object is almost completely useless however, so we use list()
# This produces a useable list of integers from the string of numbers

ints = list(map(int,nums.strip().split()))
print(ints)
```
