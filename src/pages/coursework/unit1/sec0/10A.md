# Assignment 10A: Prime finder with lists and functions

In the last unit, we started experimenting with prime numbers and using mathmatical functions. In this project, we are going to extend these basic experiments into a much more full fledged program. Your task for ths assignment is to build a program that can find all prime numbers within a given range.  
  
Your program should:
- Take an integer input that will dictate how many times the program will run
- Accept one line of input with two numbers seperated by a space. The first of these numbers will be the staring point of the prime finding zone, and the second number is the ending point of the prime finding zone. The range is inclusive of the starting number and exclusive of the ending number.
- Implement some or all of your program's logic in a **function**, which is called at least twice
- Return a single line of output per run, which consists of an array who's elements are all prime numbers within the given range
  
Example input:
```
5
1 3
2 4
5 10
10 20
100 125
```
Expected output:
```
[2]
[2, 3]
[5, 7]
[11, 13, 17, 19]
[101, 103, 107, 109, 113]
```

**Ensure that the program is written in a file named main.py. If it is not, you will not recive credit for your work!**  
To submit your program, use the turnin command with the following arguments:
```bash
turnin 10A@apcsp main.py
```
