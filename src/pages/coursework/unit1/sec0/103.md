# Functions and scope examples

## Example 0: Creating new functions
```python
# We have already gone over calling pre-made functions, but now we are going to make our own
# This is fairly simple to start with. Observe the following:
def func():
    print("Hello")
# If we run this program now, this code will not run. That is because the code in this function
# will only run if it is called, in the following way:
func()
```

## Example 1: Arguments
```python
# Now, to make functions really useful, we can allow the function to accept arguments

def add(x, y):
    z = x + y
    print(z)

add(5, 5)
print(add(4, 7))
```

## Example 2: Return values
```python
def add(x, y):
    z = x + y
    return(z)

print(add(5, 5))
print(add(4, 7))
```

## Example 3: Scope variable access
```python
def myfunc():
  x = 300
  print(x)

myfunc()
print(x) # This code will produce an error
``` 

## Example 4: Global vs enclosing scope
```python
x = 300

def myfunc():
  x = 200
  print(x)

myfunc()

print(x)
```
Although global scope is not universially bad, it should be used sparingly. Exessive use of global scope for variable data can lead to unmaintainable, unreadable code. Chainging global variables within functions can cause code that is impossible to read, and highly error prone. This is especially true as programs grow larger. Commit to good habits.
