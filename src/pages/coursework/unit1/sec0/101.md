# Strings vs Lists
Strings and lists share many similarities as we have seen throughout this lesson. However, strings are not interchangeable with lists because of some important differences. Strings can only consist of characters, while lists can contain any data type. Because of the previous difference, we cannot easily make a list into a string, but we can make a string into a list of characters, simply by using the list() function.
### Example 0: Conversion
```python
message = "Hello"
message_to_list = list(message)

print(message_to_list)
# message_to_list is now ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```
Furthermore, when we add to a string, we use the + concatenation operator to do so. With a list, we use the .append() method to add elements. Finally, one of the most important differences is mutability. Strings are immutable, meaning that we cannot update them. We could update values in a list however quite easily.  

### Example 1: Strings vs lists: mutability
```python
# This will result in this error message:
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
name = "Joe"
name[0] = "P"

# For lists, we can easily update an element
name_as_list = ["J", "o", "e"]
name_as_list[0] = "P"
# name_as_list is now ["P", "o", "e"]
```

Lastly, we should note that strings and lists have different functions. The functions that were reviewed in the lists lesson are not applicable to strings and the string functions that you will learn next are not applicable to lists. This is not much of an impediment ot a programmer however, as you can convert between the two types with ease. The differences exist because each type is built for a spesific type of data.
### Example 2: Strings vs lists general
```python
demo = "This is a string"

#Strings are very similar to lists

# They can both be accessed using bracket notation
print(demo[3])

# And they are both iterable
for i in demo:
    print(i)

# And some functions work on both
print(len(demo))

#But they are not the same. This code will not work
#print(demo.pop(-1))

#They can be converted however!
li = list(demo)
print(li)
li = str(demo)
print(li)
```
