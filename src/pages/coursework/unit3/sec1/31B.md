# OO Test

**20 questions, 7 concepts, 13 actual code**

- Encapsulation = storing multiple values and 
associated methods in one object 
(object variables, constructors that pull in data)

- abstraction = how the object hides the internal logic behind methods and constructors

- inheritance = Objects automatically pulling in variables and methods from their parents (reduces the amount of code written)

- polymorphism = Principle that child objects should behave like their parents. When something is polymorphic, it can be used interchangeably

- Remember self in non-anonymous methods

- Remember values calculated outside of the constructor are set at class creation time, not object creation time

## Object santax guide
```python
class name(parentName):
    varName = valueAtClassCreationTime
    secondVar = None

    def __init__(self):
        secondVar = valueSetAtObjectCreateTime

    def methodName(self, arguments):
        super().parentMethodName(parentMethodArgs)
```
