# Inheritance Assignment

In this assignment, you will be using the principles of Inheritance to extend the car class that we built in class. Throughout this process, you should be aiming to build polymorphic functions, so any methods belonging to a parent class should be usable on the child class. For this assignment, you should:

- Add a new method (or two) to the car class. These method(s) should load and unload passengers from the vehicle.

- Add a child class to car to represent a SUV. This SUV class should be polymorphic with the car class, but should have a bigger fuel tank, greater passenger capacity, and lower gas mileage (mpg).

- Add a second child class inheriting from car. This class does not have to be polymorphic with car, and should represent something that is tangentially related to the car class, and requires customization. This class should override at least one method belonging to its parent. Implement one new method, and use the super() function at least once anywhere in your class.
