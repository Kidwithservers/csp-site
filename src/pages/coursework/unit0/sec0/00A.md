# Project 00A: Linux scavenger hunt
In this assignment, you will have to use the Linux commands that you have learned over the last week to explore and extract data from some files in a directory. You will then submit this file using the command-line submission system. Start by copying the folder: /var/apcsp/unit0/00A to your home directory, then follow the instructions within.  
  
When you submit your finished file, ensure that:  
- You copied the files to your home folder
- You found the file in the subfolder
- You have filtered the text, and redirected the output to a new file
- You edited the file as specified
- You submitted the new file
  
As a reminder, to submit this assignment, you would use the tunin command as follows: ```turnin 00A@apcsp file_or_folder_to turn_in``` where file_or_folder_to turn_in is replaced with the path to the actual file or folder to turn in.
