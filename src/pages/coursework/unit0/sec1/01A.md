# Abstraction at the lower levels assignment

Over the last few days, we have learned about several features of computers from both the realms of programming and operating systems. In this assignment, please select one advance from each of the two topics that we have reviewed, and write about how these features abstract more complex lower level functionality, and improve usability of the underlying feature. There is no hard page requirement for this assignment, but I would recommend that your submission be between 1 and 2 pages double spaced. Before you submit your assignment, ensure that you have covered:

1. The function of the abstraction
2. The actual lower level function(s) being abstracted, what they do, and and a brief overview of how they work
3. The benefits of abstracting the function (less work for the programmer/user, less possibility of mistakes and bugs, increased compatibility, etc

for a topic from both categories. Feel free to use google on this assignment if you want to research more about the topic that you are writing about. Most of what you are need to know is included in the powerpoints and your notes (the OS powerpoint will be up soon), but do not be constrained by these sources.  I know that these types of writing assignments are boring, but this prompt is an almost word-for-word copy of a prompt that will be on your AP exam.

## Operating systems
User interface
- Drivers
- Kernel
- Virtual memory
- Programming

## Compilers
- Assembly language
- Dynamic memory management
- High level languages generally
